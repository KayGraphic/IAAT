# IAAT
A repository for the Indiana Archive for Abandoned Technology
The IAAC is northeast Indiana’s only known facility for the preservation, portrayal and promotion of consumer grade electronics from the golden age of single purpose machines. Every year, hundreds of thousands of pieces of obsolete technology are consigned to the junk pile of history, and with good reason. Modern advances in manufacturing and science have brought forth stunning multipurpose tools that do everything these former objects did and more. 
Soon there will come a time when the objects collected in this facility will be unrecognizable in both in form and function.
Our work is to collect and describe these formerly cutting edge devices and to contextualize their place within the lives of the people who bought, used and mastered  their everyday use.

#THE INDIANA ARCHIVE OF ABANDONED TECHNOLOGY IS AN ART INSTALLATION…
that addresses the expansion of the Digital Era and the contraction of the Analogue Era. The installation consists of performance art, nostalgic collection development, and artwork inspired by the industrial design of that phase of human/machine interaction.
