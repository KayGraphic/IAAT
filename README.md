# IAAT
A repository for the Indiana Archive for Abandoned Technology
The IAAC is northeast Indianaâ€™s only known facility for the preservation, portrayal and promotion of consumer grade electronics from the golden age of single purpose machines. Every year, hundreds of thousands of pieces of obsolete technology are consigned to the junk pile of history, and with good reason. Modern advances in manufacturing and science have brought forth stunning multipurpose tools that do everything these former objects did and more. 
Soon there will come a time when the objects collected in this facility will be unrecognizable in both in form and function.
Our work is to collect and describe these formerly cutting edge devices and to contextualize their place within the lives of the people who bought, used and mastered  their everyday use.
